I am currently a Machine Learning Research Engineer Intern at [Unbabel](https://unbabel.com/) where I research and develop machine translation systems. My broader interests lie with machine learning and natural language processing in general, with a special focus on deep generative models and variational inference.

Beforehand, I was a PhD candidate at the [Institute for Language, Cognition and Computation](http://web.inf.ed.ac.uk/ilcc) in Edinburgh. My research, under the supervision of Dr [Ivan Titov](http://ivan-titov.org/) and Dr [Alexandra Birch](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/abmayne/), was focused on low-resource machine translation with generative models, i.e. on creating machine translation models that can thrive under data sparsity. I decided to leave my PhD after one year because I did not enjoy the solitary nature of the work. Yet, I am still interested in (applied) research, albeit in a more collaborative and goal-oriented environment.

In my spare time I like to climb, hike and [read](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/42352147-tom-pelsmaeker).
