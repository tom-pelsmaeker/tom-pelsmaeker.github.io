I am a *PhD candidate* at the [Institute for Language, Cognition and Computation](http://web.inf.ed.ac.uk/ilcc) in Edinburgh. Here, I am part of the [Statistical Machine Translation](http://www.statmt.org/ued/) and [EdinburghNLP](http://edinburghnlp.inf.ed.ac.uk/) groups.

My research, under the supervision of Dr [Ivan Titov](http://ivan-titov.org/) and Dr [Alexandra Birch](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/abmayne/), is focused on *low-resource machine translation*, i.e. on creating models of (neural) machine translation that can thrive under data sparsity. This research is part of the [GoURMET](https://gourmet-project.eu/) project, a European collaboration between academia and media to advance journalism to and from low-resource languages. In a broader sense, I am interested in deep generative models and variational inference, especially when applied to natural language processing. One day, I hope we can approach models that can generate convincing natural language from true language understanding.
